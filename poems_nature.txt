The rustling leaves in the gentle breeze,
 Whisper secrets of nature with ease.
 The sunshines down on the stream,
 Reflecting the beauty of nature's dream.
 The flowers bloom with color bright,
 Filling the air with sweet delight.
 The birds sing with joyful glee,
 As they soar above towering tree.
 The rivers flow with gentle grace,
 Carrying life to every place.
 The stars shines bright in the night,
 Guiding us with their celestial light.
 Nature's beauty is all around,
 In every sight,
 every scent and every sound


Poem:
 The sun glistens through the trees,
 The wind blows its gentle breeze.
 The clouds gently passing by,
 The birds are flying way up high.
 A bird is singing his morning song,
 The world around him carries on.
 A flower blooms for all to see,
 And food is found for the bumblebee.
 The grass grows greener every day,
 The fields are stacked with bales of hay.
 The flowers grow from the seeds we sow,
 It’s too Mother Nature,
 thanks we owe.
 Life is just full of beautiful things,
 Just look around at all the scenes.
 Close your eyes and listen to the sounds,
 An inner peace will be found.

Blue bird sang On the orchid tree; Red tulip blossoms!


When the sunlight breached through the clouds,
 As rays seep through my window to kiss my
face.
 It confronts my dream,
 evoking me to rise and shine,
 My heart brims with excitement for a new day.
 I could hear the babel of birds outside,
 I went out to feel nature,
 filled with lush green.
 The branches of trees spider like webs,
 And butterflies flitter around the garden for nectar.
 I found solace gazing at this amazing view,
 Eager to walk ahead and embrace this nature.
 This feeling surges within me like a powerful wave,
 A tethered bond I long for with this kindled
beauty.


As the sun rises in the east of sky,
 In search of food all little birds fly,
 On big-small leaves,
 there are drops of dew,
 The day is beautiful and the day is new.
 Under the rays of sun,
 dew drops glisten,
 To the chirps of bird,
 I carefully listen,
 The strings of flowers,
 on the big-tall trees,
 The lush greenery with soft-green leaves.
 Rain pours down from sky to earth,
 It cleans the earth,
 it removes the dirt,
 The grey sky and the thick black clouds,
 Bright are the lightnings and thunders loud.
 The thirsty soil is quenched by water,
 On shiny flowers,
 the butterflies flutter,
 The leaves bounce to the drops of rain,
 They bounce again and again and again.
 The rain's set and a rainbow slides down the
sky,
 Along with it,
 I see a group of birds fly,
 The nature's always kind and good,
 The smiling nature lifts up your mood.
 Now the sun sets in the west of sky,
 To their nests,
 all little birds fly,
 The night falls and the stars glisten,
 To the quiet nature,
 I carefully listen.
.

I walk down an old forest trail.
 I take each step on ancient soil.
 I look around.
 Trees stand tall above me.
 The branches stretch out with leaves that cover the
sun from my eyes.
 Flowers bloom in patches on the ground.
 The small critters run around me fast to where
I can’t catch of glimpse of them.
 I looked around one more time.
 I notice how the landscape all comes together,
 to make a beautiful scenery.
 It’s the true beauty in nature.
 I love nature.
 Unfortunately,
 it won’t stay like this forever.


The earth gives melody sometimes it's frightening,
 maybe it's the sound of thunder or the brightness
of lightening,
 the grass gives beauty,
 and the seas keeps flowing,
 I hear the wind keeps blowing,
 that's the sound of living,
 life keeps on going


Mother cries in the night,
 Holding in the pain of countless millennia,
 ironic that she has been taken hostage by her
own creation,
 sealed behind an intricate web of wayward ideas,
 lies and dead thoughts.
 A birthing out of love can only end in
sadness,
 she dances amongst the pale moon lit sky,
 in the hopes of passing the torch on while
forever keeping the fire alight for many a wayward wanderer
and weary soul deciding to make the long trek home.
 See the flames flicker then spark,
 then grow cold and dim in their eyes,
 suddenly extinguished within the pupils and hearts of men.
 A world grown cold I sit and observe the
rushing rapids the fierce flow of a day's rainfall the
freshwater crayfish clinging to the river's bank,
 water muddied,
 swirling,
 cascading over the rocks reaching out for stable footing
is met with fierce undercurrents to be swept downstream.
 Gone with the flow,
 simply no more.
 Fungi grows about the trees untouched by man's hands,
 vibrant reds,
 orange and earthy browns.
 The Sun shows itself piercing through the canopy and
suddenly the whole scene comes alive and the world can
now be seen within every drop of dew if you
look a little closer.
 Reflecting spirit The mighty oak weathering many a storm.
 The Ivy clings to its host,
 hoisting it far into the treeline in a vast
effort to receive and reach out to the light.
 A Warm embrace.
 Today I dine amongst the nymphs,
 the fairies,
 sprites,
 goblins,
 spirits and elementals and the memories and quiet echos
of men and women before us.
 The land under foot.
 But most of all to remember a mother's embrace,
 kindness and love,
 her lessons harsh yet her wisdom fair.
 The breath of life rolls slowly over the hills
and into the valley below.
 Myst carpets the path trodden,
 however I see the flames now lashing,
 and the sparks sizzle and crack through the cold
nights air.
 A familiar place.
 Welcome home.
 An enigma no more.


The sight of the hills is a beauty The bright
moon is the sign of purity The flow of the
river is a murmuring music The act of the sun
is so philanthropic.
 The rain of the clouds is very refreshing The
blowing of the wind is so soothing The roaring of
the ocean has its own reason How charming is the
changing of the season!
 The wide blue sky above and high Gives us
space to dream and to fly How nice the dew
drops on the leaves to see!
 Everything has its own beauty,
 fly or a flea The trees tells us how
to give food,
 shadow and shelter How sweet to quench our thirst
with fresh cool water!
 Does life thrive without the mercy of the great
nature?


Nature is kind Nature is beautiful Nature is fine Nature
is fruitful That is the reason why It looks nice
and plentiful Roses and figs Are such a nice seasoning
on the hills If a man tries and wills So
many best dreams he can fulfill Hafiz Muhammad Qasim


nature follows nothing flowing rivers of peace grass so green
you'd be filled with greed a stary night sky the
gentle warm breeze embracing everything around me why cant you
see how beautiful it is?


A douglas fir tree stands high like a skyscraper while
it flourishes


Full of rebellion,
 I would die,
 Or fight,
 or travel,
 or deny That thou has aught to do with
me.
 O tame my heart; It is thy highest art
To captivate strong holds to thee.
 If thou shalt let this venom lurk,
 And in suggestions fume and work,
 My soul will turn to bubbles straight,
 And thence by kind Vanish into a wind,
 Making thy workmanship deceit.
 O smooth my rugged heart,
 and there Engrave thy rev'rend law and fear; Or
make a new one,
 since the old Is sapless grown,
 And a much fitter stone To hide my dust,
 than thee to hold.


Still waters pooling Deeply windowed imagery In your eyes picture
With my eyes a pictured colored frame.


nature is a beauitful thing you can almost see everything
in nature,
 sitting there seeing everything everywhere one day ,
i was sitting outside trying to look ,
 but not hide look at nature.
i saw a doe running around i saw another one
on the ground everyone  should go outside and watch all
the buzzards glide and w atch the deer prance around
you have to stay for a while or you won't
hear a sound


I see the clouds I watch the trees Blowing gracefully
in the breeze,
 I've seen the beautiful flower bloom Watched it grow
but now it dies,
 The purpose of it's living still unseen The spoils
of its demise


Oh!
 nature Loving and cozy You  who mother's all creature
Creating a place so tranquil And full of serenity Awoken
from the dream-world By the loving voice of a singing
bird I stand over logs of dead woods Stepping on
innocent lying leaves Over whelmed by the tender wind Like
that from the sea-side The gurgling sounds echoes The giant
woods dance And gives opening for a beautiful sun-ray where
you can see the picture of a beautiful day


It is the prakriti; that functions and compels everyone to
act.

Love makes me cry.
 At 65 age what do I dream of? To
die of natural causes.

The bubbling brook doth leap when I come by,
 Because my feet find measure with its call; The
birds know when the friend they love is nigh,
 For I am known to them,
 both great and small.
 The flower that on the lonely hillside grows Expects
me there when spring its bloom has given; And many
a tree and bush my wanderings knows,
 And e'en the clouds and silent stars of heaven;
For he who with his Maker walks aright,
 Shall be their lord as Adam was before; His
ear shall catch each sound with new delight,
 Each object wear the dress that then it wore;
And he,
 as when erect in soul he stood,
 Hear from his Father's lips that all is good


Once upon a blue sky,
 laced with golden hues,
 I laid my eyes upon a cloud,
 that reminded me of you,
 And in the midst of reckoning,
  I saw your smiling face,
 Then like a wisp of smoke you vanished from
this place I start to walk along a path full
of cobblestone,
 But couldn’t shake the feeling I wasn’t all alone
In the depths of the treetops a spix called out
your name,
 Startled and confused,
 I too did the same Your voice seemed to
whisper from the wind that blew my hair,
 Reaching out to catch it,
 were you really there A warm and tender light,
 settled near my feet,
 As if a long lost friend coming here to
meet A light rain started falling,
 which sounded like your laughter,
 I’m not sure the game nature’s playing,
 or exactly what she’s after But here along this
path,
 confusion takes control,
 And all I really know is from me darkness
stole My heart is in utter turmoil,
 its breaking me in two,
 With the images that nature is pretending to be
you You’ve long since gone from here,
 with memories left unknown Like the flame from a
candle after it’s been blown Once upon natures lie,
 her illusions made me see,
 Lured in by nature’s mask,
 I lost myself completely


As a fond mother,
 when the day is o'er,
 Leads by the hand her little child to bed,
 Half willing,
 half reluctant to be led,
 And leave his broken playthings on the floor,
 Still gazing at them through the open door,
 Nor wholly reassured and comforted By promises of others
in their stead,
 Which though more splendid,
 may not please him more; So Nature deals with
us,
 and takes away Our playthings one by one,
 and by the hand Leads us to rest so
gently,
 that we go Scarce knowing if we wish to
go or stay,
 Being too full of sleep to understand How far
the unknown transcends the what we know.


The rain falls from the sky.
 The trees are filled with rain.
 Brown fill liquids fill the brim of the cup.
 The rain drops fall on the table.
 I glanced at the rain filled leaves.
 Rain drops lands on the house.


The light of the sky,
 the lush of the earth,
 The life of the waters at liberty flow,
 The peaceful tranquil in a fall from the sky,
 The whisper and roar of the sea call for
glee.
 The noisy silence in a green land forest,
 The beauty of Earth is a wonder.
 Explore!
 But what's beyond sight is what is yet to
come.
 A kingdom of gold,
 sapphires,
 and gems.
 If Earth is such beauty and there's more than
beauty,
 Oh!
 That I may live through Earth's beauty and wonder,
 And in peaceful grey transit to heaven's yonder.


leaves gently sway with the morning’s stir like the gentle
rustle of my sheets awakening as I do they catch

Jasmine is a little heavenly creature It has got a
softness in the hand,
 That charms at any cost Those little beautiful white
angles,
 In the little white flowers,
 A cuddling architecture.
 And then as you put it on And expect
an white angel… Cuddling!
 And long legged,
 You sense that dark wood,
 That comes from the depths of earth.
 As of petrichor,
 Trunks,
 In the depths of the forest.
 It would be amazing to be like jasmine.
 A dual entity.
 Smoking and evaporating from one world to another.
 The sweetest of angels,
 for some who see Accepts and gifts a complete
comfort,
 Overcoming resistance that may be offered If your eyes
are weak,
 use the looking glass,
 To see the barely bearably beauty of the petals,
 They embrace you so as you melt there in
joy.
 Wrapped in this near-ecstasy Give yourself fully to this
pure lovely whiteness.
.
.
 Fully,
 mutually,
 lovingly embraced!
 Standing tall and joyously,
 You do not fear the deep,
 dark moss of the wood,
 You feel the full gentle power of our Mother.
 It's more than a smell,
 Coming from beneath,
 above and all around you,
 You're truly home here in this deep green place.
 We can almost be there as mortal angels.
 Free ourselves to be there too as we are
here,
 now.
 Vaporous yet complete,
 Whole,
 free to go any or everywhere as we please


Staying in the nature and keeping all the stuff to
do later,
 Spending some time with peace on the bleachers,
 Feelinng the cool breeze by setting under the huge
trees,
 Listening the buzzing sound made by bees Listening them
by sitting near the seas,
 Having no fear of life-and-death By staying in the
world of liars and wires,
 Where no one is honest and keeps their promises
Where people believe in royalty but loyalty has disappeared,
 Staying in the nature and stop thinking what is
true and untrue,
 Staying blessed and having some rest,
 By stop carrying of North,
South,
East and West.
 Thank you.


Nature The look of beauty That strikes you as you
pass by In the spring Where lovers laugh Under falling
cherry blossoms Where mother blue jays Feed their young Proud
to see Their children Spreading their wings But no one
dares looks at the beauty of Winter A silent beauty
A definition of a dead beauty White blankets the ground
Numbing to the touch Quiet surrounds me Taking me in
Quiet Beautiful.
 Yet despised by many.
 They don’t see the trees hanging on to life
Like a human hanging on to the last of their
sanity They don’t see the small daffodils Thriving While other
plants Stay coated Under the colorless drapes They don’t understand,
 The beauty of wintertime


How beautiful nature can be See how the wind blows
and kiss the leaves Oh,
 the way the sun shines so bright To give
light to the world that is dark at night I'm
watching the flowers dance all around with such demand,
 to the soothing sounds of the wind Listen to
the rain that hits the ground,
 get a glimpse of the children splashing around How
beautiful,
 the storm the different lights,
 light up the sky You can see the birds
flying high The moon sits as the stars sparkle all
around it In the mid of the day the roses
bloom with a sweet aroma that fills the room Look
around at the eagles.
.
.
.
.
oh the way they soar.
See the couple promising each other forever more Nature at
it's finest with endless beautiful scenes Going to sleep with
thoughts of nature will bring the most amazing dreams.


The rolling green hills,
 The towering trees,
 Nobody around,
 To spoil the beauty of nature.
 No houses about,
 No busy roads,
 Just me and the country,
 In this untouched piece of world


Nature,
 oh nature,
 how you astound Your beauty and majesty forever abound
From rolling hills to snow-capped peaks our wonder and splendor
never seems to ebb or leak.
 The chirping of birds and buzzing of bees Fill
the air in sweet melodies pleasing to the trees The
rustling of leaves and the whispering of wind Create a
seren eambiance,
 that's tough to rescind.
 The greenery all around,
 the flowers in bloom Making the Earth seem like
agiant room Fragrant breezes that carry the mountain air Hikes
and treks that people eagerly dare.
 The ocean and its infinite depths below Holding the
secrets of the creatures that glow A visual of color,
 movement,
 and grace The tide that ebbs or flows at
its Own pace.


Trees,
 the calmness of the world.
 their branches are curled.
 the leaves fall to the ground,
 the leaves rustle and make sound.
 Bees collect honey,
 we take it and sell it for money.
 Bees live in a hive,
 together they can thrive.
 In winter the world is frozen.
 If you found a bear den would you go
in? Bears have a lot of power.
 I like to eat flowers,
 maybe thats why i get sick all the time.
 This is the end of the rhyme


Day,
 take me far from the noise of traffic!
 Wonder fields of wild flowers Jeannine look flight of
birds is ballet I've never seen,
 Sunlit shadows play upon the land!
 Joe God's creation deserves our attention.
 Aw!
 Jeannine,
 when autumn leaves salute the glorious sunset May our
wedding vows by spoken? Joseph,
 I do love you.
 Hey girl,
 Uncle Bill offered me 10 acres of his farm
for a marriage gift!
 Ya Honey,
 far from traffic.
 For together we plant and harvest!
 Jeannine,
 my friends help me build a house!
 Oh you pretty girl I love you.


How beautiful nature can be,
 you can see how the wind blows and kiss
the leaf's.
 The way the sun shines so bright,
 to give light to a world that is dark
at night.
 I'm watching the flowers dance all around with such
demand to the soothing sounds of the wind.
 Listen to the rain as it hits the ground,
 get a glimpse of the children splashing around.
 How beautiful,
 the storm the different lights,
 light up the sky.
 You can see the birds flying high.
 The moon sits,
 while the stars sparkle all around it.
 in the mid of the day the roses bloom,
 with a sweet aroma that fills the room.
 Look at the eagles,
 aww.
.
.
.
 the way they soar.
 See the couple promising each other forever more.
 Nature at its finest,
 with endless beautiful scenes.
 going to sleep with thoughts of nature will bring
the most amazing dreams.


We first met when I was young.
 Curious,
 expectant,
 open-minded We explored each other freely,
 Communing face to face Sharing everything Seeking each other's
company,
 together Under the open sky.
 Middle aged we met again.
 Striving,
 over-reaching,
 exploitative We looked to our own advantage.
 Stormy clouds gathering On the horizon,
 Presaging dangerous times ahead of us Under the threat'ning
sky.
 Now I am older I see her Dull-eyed,
 disconsolate,
 all too aware Of what we were and have
become.
 Her cycle confused,
 Stripped bare,
 ripped apart Craving to be isolate,
 for solitude Under the darkened sky.
 She will still be there when I'm gone.
 Forgotten,
 unrecognised,
 unaware Of what we once had and had lost.
 Her nature restored,
 Newly clothed,
 new born Thriving in her renewed joy in life
Under the spring sun sky.


Nature The leaves on the birch trees were fluttering softly
on the ground,
 The cheerful chirps of the birds could be heard
all around,
 The flowers were gently swaying from the wonderful breeze
The hot sun was blazing,
 the temperature rose to 35 degrees.
 The dew was now long gone and the flowers
started wilting,
 On the little pond  in the clearing was a
lost duckling,
 See all this beauty? Let us be thankful For
who knows when people will destroy it all Tell your
friends and family to be grateful.
 I do not want to see all these beautiful
things fall.


You are very unique and pretty And I find you
kinda relaxing and witty Your mountains,
 beaches,
 and cities All things we see with ease Your
white clouds fill the skies at morning You make them
round and fluffy Like cotton candy in the evening When
the sun is out of sight Your storms are very
calming Even when your thunder is rolling And your rain
pours all morning Then stops and a rainbow forms


Snowflakes gently fall Blanketing the landscape white Winter's peaceful hush


Hearing the wave


NATURE.
 The tranquil peace of early morn The sunrise in
the sky The new day greets us with the dawn
And lifts our gaze on high.
 For when the sun has risen high And then
begins to sink God paints the sky a fiery red
Which fades to gentle pink.
 As darkness falls and stars appear It is a
wondrous sight The universe spread out above A mass of
twinkling light.
 Such beauty,
 not of human hand Is there for us to
see All nature is so wonderful The cost is nil,
 all free.

As the birds sing good morning I recall the days
when I was young Waking up on a Sunday morning
to my father hollering “breakfast” My mother,
 a nurse,
 often slept through breakfast.
 My father,
 a bookkeeper,
 let her sleep.
 My brothers and sister took their time getting to
the table knowing Sunday School was on the way.
 I,
 being the youngest,
 looked forward to getting up and going to Sunday
School.
  I was too young to experience what they had
experienced in a Pentecostal church.
 As my neighbors take their dog and go to
wherever they go to worship God,
 the birds still chirp their happy tune.
  I listen to them because as a child I
appreciated nature,
 it speaks to me,
 as God intended it to.
  I know my siblings enjoyed nature also,
 each in our own way.
 Nature.
  God’s entertainment.
  It costs us nothing,
 but time to listen.


Another Beautiful Calm Day Emerges Fast.
 Growing Happy Is Just Kaffir Lily,
 Magnifying Nature's Own Pretty Quesnelia.
 Revealing Some Tremendous Unique Views,
 Which Xenops Yearn Zealously.


O Nature!
 I do not aspire To be the highest in
thy choir,
 - To be a meteor in thy sky,
 Or comet that may range on high; Only a
zephyr that may blow Among the reeds by the river
low; Give me thy most privy place Where to run
my airy race.
 In some withdrawn,
 unpublic mead Let me sigh upon a reed,
 Or in the woods,
 with leafy din,
 Whisper the still evening in:
 Some still work give me to do,
 - Only - be it near to you!
 For I'd rather be thy child And pupil,
 in the forest wild,
 Than be the king of men elsewhere,
 And most sovereign slave of care; To have one
moment of thy dawn,
 Than share the city's year forlorn.


Look at the sunshine “What a beautiful day!
” Under the trees “We can run and play.
” Yet we pollute nature.
 What will happen to it in the future? By
cutting down trees and animals How long is Mother Earth
going to live? Nature is getting older and older.
 Are we going to live any longer? The bolder
and bolder we get.
 The shorter and shorter the nature lives.


Oh!
 Wow!
 The nature is blooming And the trees are ready
to glooming A tree that offers us peace and calmness
And end our all loneliness.
 Oh!
 Wow!
 The nature is sky-high Unfold your wings to fly
high The sun is out and shining Listen to the
birds they are singing.
 Oh!
 Wow!
 The nature is so watery Life is like an
ocean,
 dangerous salty So many creatures with fins and gills
Ocean is much bigger than it seems.
 Oh!
 Wow!
 The nature is so refreshing The trees,
 sky and ocean are so fascinating Nature is everywhere
you go So listen,
learn to keep nature beautiful FOREVER TO GO!


O how canst thou renounce the boundless store Of charms
which Nature to her votary yields!
 The warbling woodland,
 the resounding shore,
 The pomp of groves,
 and garniture of fields; All that the genial ray
of morning gilds,
 And all that echoes to the song of even,
 All that the mountain's sheltering bosom shields,
 And all the dread magnificence of heaven,
 O how canst thou renounce and hope to be
forgiven!


Nature is like mother's hands at work Always healing forgotten
wounds Holding the most precious life Waiting to come out
of her womb.
 Man is like an enemy Destroying the fruits of
the land Killing animals who are weak in defense Waiting
to get some kind of vengeance.
 She hopes that someday soon Man will come out
of his dreadful loon And open his eyes to realize
Life is a precious thing to lose.


nature is everywhere all around us in our homes outside
of our houses we breathe in nature i love nature


I.
 Winters know Easily to shed the snow,
 And the untaught Spring is wise In cowslips and
anemones.
 Nature,
 hating art and pains,
 Baulks and baffles plotting brains; Casualty and Surprise Are
the apples of her eyes; But she dearly loves the
poor,
 And,
 by marvel of her own,
 Strikes the loud pretender down.
 For Nature listens in the rose,
 And hearkens in the berry's bell,
 To help her friends,
 to plague her foes,
 And like wise God she judges well.
 Yet doth much her love excel To the souls
that never fell,
 To swains that live in happiness,
 And do well because they please,
 Who walk in ways that are unfamed,
 And feats achieve before they're named.
 II.
 She is gamesome and good,
 But of mutable mood,
-- No dreary repeater now and again,
 She will be all things to all men.
 She who is old,
 but nowise feeble,
 Pours her power into the people,
 Merry and manifold without bar,
 Makes and moulds them what they are,
 And what they call their city way Is not
their way,
 but hers,
 And what they say they made to-day,
 They learned of the oaks and firs.
 She spawneth men as mallows fresh,
 Hero and maiden,
 flesh of her flesh; She drugs her water and
her wheat With the flavours she finds meet,
 And gives them what to drink and eat; And
having thus their bread and growth,
 They do her bidding,
 nothing loath.
 What's most theirs is not their own,
 But borrowed in atoms from iron and stone,
 And in their vaunted works of Art The master-stroke
is still her part.
