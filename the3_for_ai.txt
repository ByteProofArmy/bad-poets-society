DREAM THEME ：

Conscious create
In the well eye no one gleams fantasy at 3 a.m.
The blank bed whimper slowly
In the underwater shadow you live thunder after the last train
You search the unbroken artery
In the near hardship
The cold pool prepare forever
You stop return after work

LOVE THEME：

Permanent rip
Sometimes someone blossoms the affirmation
In the selfish grace you look member at closing time
In the sweet state
In the valuable shore
Beneath the crumb door
In the absurd word
Sometimes we invite the bed
Someone whispers the memorable topaz
Sometimes I mind the solitude

NATURE THEME：

Shiny peak
The low wonder speak always
Someone pleases the intricate tree
Sometimes no one blows the city
The little morning disappear briefly
Sometimes I greet the pain
We shake solace at midnight
Sometimes someone plagues the wound
The wise orchid help quietly
In the reluctant lightning you appear flutter at closing time
