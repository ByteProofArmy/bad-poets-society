LOVE The morn is giving birth To the dawn- yet
to reign,
 still budding,
 undone.
 Shall you play the earth,
 And me the sun? - Why not? - Let
us go,
 let us go Where the blue currents run,
 Now hither,
 now there,
 now high,
 now low,
 Upon the lot Of the breeze-caressed hill.
 Let me kiss your sweet flesh of the daffodil,
 And embrace you in the waking glen.
 And then,
 let me love you In the succulent vineyards,
 In the blooms of the hazy,
 yawning garden.
 And there,
 beneath the greenish hue Of the quickening firmament,
 Astonishing and bright,
 Where lovers and bards Succor in the sunlight Nipples
of crimson,
 lips of wine,
 Beneath the fleecy willows bent,
 Let our bodies unite In the rapture of the
sunshine,
 Where sure delight Is yours and mine.
 And the approaching rain Shall find us- twain In
spirit and in flesh,
 Indeed as one- As the gray clouds mesh With
the scarlet sun.
 JOHN LARS ZWERENZ


Love dost breathe the breath of life.


Sharing what's on your mind; Giving treasures you find,
 Serving the deaf and blind; Helping those in a
bind.
 Gifts which are creative; Being quick to forgive,
 Patience each day you live; Give comfort; be sensitive.
 A warm smile on your face; Serving others with
grace,
 Acceptance,
 an embrace; And giving your friends space.
 Giving compliments,
 praise; Sending some shining rays,
 Attending your friends' plays; Serving in many ways.
 Knowing how your friends feel; And when they need
to heal.
 Giving people a meal Because their needs are real.


I do not love you as if you were salt-rose,
 or topaz,
 or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off.
 I love you as certain dark things are to
be loved,
 in secret,
 between the shadow and the soul.
 I love you as the plant that never blooms
but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers; thanks
to your love a certain solid fragrance,
 risen from the earth,
 lives darkly in my body.
 I love you without knowing how,
 or when,
 or from where.
 I love you straightforwardly,
 without complexities or pride; so I love you because
I know no other way than this:
 where I does not exist,
 nor you,
 so close that your hand on my chest is
my hand,
 so close that your eyes close as I fall
asleep.


My heart speaks to thee It longs to be free
Trapped deep inside If stuck too long it may die
Then it could see The part of me That wants
you…


Love is so difficult to understand It's silent and sometimes
sad Its happiness filled with content Cherishing in the hope
of keeping Makes time seem so short It keeps giving
and giving Love is reaching out for friendship


I loved you from afar I did not know you
loved me too How loss I have been without you
in my life Then you ask me to come visit
It became a beautiful dream Now we are together You
are the love of my life


Love What a simple love is our love!
 What a roaring river is our dream!
 What do I say about her intimacy? Warm and
pleasant? What do I say about her loyalty? Always kind,
 always be for me? Give her hand to my
hand,
 great Lord.
 I am so alone without her these days.


LOVE Fragile as a spider's web,
 hanging in space Between tall grasses,
 it is torn again and again.
 A passing dog,
 or simply the wind can do it.
 Several times a day I gather myself together and
spin it again.
 Spiders are patient weavers.
 They never give up.
 And who knows what keeps them at it? Hunger,
 no doubt,
 And hope.


Love My name is love,
some claim to know Me but they don't,
 you claim to know all about me but you
don't.
 I'm one foreign feeling no one can resist .
I clash two hearts together,
 make them dance to the same tune until my
mission to find the missing piece to my angle comes
knocking on the door to remind me of what I
came for I'm out of this world ,
I'm undefined and will never Be defined.
i come in different angles that is why you can
never find the right angle and the way to it,
I'm as that.
i try to bring you all together but I'mout of
this world,
 very far away from this world.
i'm here because of my mission If you are in
need of me you go hunt me down,
 but remember "out of this world " By :
O.
Sijiba


Love A shield that rips apart from itself to form
a spear and my heart refuses to wear helmet My
love speaks in silence Without ideals or violence It sings
the song of souls It give a pair of lungs
to breathe.
.
.
Anointed by the seeds within my fold.
.
 The harmony of a war that peaches silence and
peace,
 The light that flicker from our laughter.
.
.
 Our lips have been burned so many times to
forget.
.
.
 so I know how it feels to be allergic
to love.
 It is the nonverbal human interaction,
 The intimacy of a daydream off my eyes.
.
.
 rolled off my skin like sleeves,
 how it unravels the truth untold.
.
.
 It is the unquenchable thirst of these longing passion
vividly embossed.
.
.
 The deafening sound of a cracking thought spiced by
the melodies of my heart,
 the precise mathematics of my brains.
.
.
 the thought to return you to my rips.
 You crossed my mind once and never left,
 you hv sense of permanent in actual thoughts in
many versions of reality.
.
.
 It is the spirit of purity that feels like
home,
 the remedy of perpetual healing repeatedly gone unproven.
 Only familiarity breeds contend,
 ignorance is living in shame of being human.
 You are the shores sucking my feet drawn deep,
 losing the feathers of your warm code would make
me weep and if you wish to ever leave,
 I would finally understand why storms are named after
people.
 ©️HISTORIAN POET ABBIE


Love does not come detached.
 separate It lives among the fray.
 It doesn't always carry flowers,
 or invite us clearly in.
 It lives in light and shadow it swims beneath
the skin.
 It lived in the flower beds,
 and among the battling weeds.
 it shines in goodness and charity and between hate,
 and lust and greed It lives in the silent
gaps,
 between action ,
thoughts,
 and words.
 Love the very stuff of life,
 the glue that binds this world.


Love isn't just a word,
 its an action Saying I love you jus the
beginning of what's supposed to happen Actions speak louder than
words and love is a verb Therefore if I speak
it you'll see it,
 even if I may seem absurd You love with
everything you do From getting the kids ready to coming
home to cook food From helping a neighbor to feeding
the homeless,
 love is in all that you do You can't
tell me you love me and act like i'm a
stranger If you love me then lets be goofy and
act like a park ranger Love is more than a
feeling it's a part of life When i say I
love you I mean it with ALL MY LIFE!
 Youll know its true from the things I do
I wont just say it i'll surely show you From
holding the door to paying a bill I hold nothing
back because my love is real From crying to laughter
i'm always there No matter what happens my love wont
disappear Real talks in the night that get heated and
deep They come from love,
 never from anger inside of me See love is
strong and love is true,
 cause you could cuss me out and i'll still
say I love you No matter the situation i'm on
your side Arms wide open with your feelings in mind
When you cry I cry cause I feel your pain
Even if you've done wrong i'll still love you the
same See love isn't just a word it's an action
When i say i love you be prepared for what's
going to happen An abundance of care and gifts and
affirmation At times you'll think I must be crazy Partly
its true,
 cause i'm crazy about you Even better than that
it's cause I LOVE YOU


Of all the love I have to give How rarely
it is used Oh dear god forgive me for withholding
All the love I have for you And all the
love I’ve ever shared Was some of it misused? Is
it better to withhold If it’s bound to be abused?
I’ve gone plenty of days Without hearing I love you
I’ve gone plenty more Without saying it too Oh how
cold the well of my soul seems to run when
I stop sharing my love Oh how barren and useless
it feels to always act so tough Sickness pervades and
does it’s best to keep my hands tied But the
tears I cry,
 they are filled with the love that I keep
inside Oh and how cruel it feels to look deep
in someone’s eyes And feel my heart turn over but
still produce a disguise Do I betray all life when
I admit my love is forever Then turn my back
on it all together? I want nothing more in this
life than to love all till the end What again
was ever the point in playing pretend? Dear lord let
me always have a helping hand to lend And let
me greet every eye with the openness of a friend
Only love can save us from the damnation that is
existence Only love can lift the spirit that thrives so
fiercely within us Only love holds the key to all
we could ever really want Only love can turn the
most dire occurrence into a bit of careless fun Only
love will embrace the tears that fall down our face
And protect and guide our precious human race Only love
will make everything that’s happened okay And make the past
look like a beautiful sequence of days Only love will
be there when you’ve completely let go Like a spring
that runs from the depths of your soul Of all
possessions,
 moments and days Love is the most valuable And
no one can take it away


Love is blind Love conquers all Love is perfect only
when shared Love is a wonderful thing Love is like
a litany Love is beautiful Love is selfish Love is
infatuating Love is like chocolate Love is sweet Love is
lust Love is tearful Love is cheerful Love is merry
Love is glorious Love is dangerous Love is mindful Love
is tolerant Love is caring Love is sharing Love is
life


Love is not skin deep that makes the heart leaps,
love is a treasure given by God for us to
keep,
for each time we care and each time we share,
we are expressing our love the very same.
                Love is not lust,
for that lasts for a while,
love is everlasting that never dies for true love is
shown by our Saviour above that died on Calvary's cross.


Love is the deepest passion It exists in one or
a few And it carries a lot of mildew


Not you have love But love has you Just like
a drop of water Into the sea Not you have
the sea But the sea has you Love Never been
owned by a man Can not be owned by anyone
Can be owned is not love But it is like
Love is there Is the end result of life Constant
there Love is God's wish Waiting for you to join
Until you become love


She is in love ,
 She is his beloved .


Love!
--what is love? a mere machine,
 a spring For freaks fantastic,
 a convenient thing,
 A point to which each scribbling wight most steer,
 Or vainly hope for food or favour here; A
summer's sigh; a winter's wistful tale:
 A sound at which th' untutor'd maid turns pale;
Her soft eyes languish,
 and her bosom heaves,
 And Hope delights as Fancy's dream deceives.
 Thus speaks the heart which cold disgust invades,
 When time instructs,
 and Hope's enchantment fades; Through life's wide stage,
 from sages down to kings,
 The puppets move,
 as art directs the strings:
 Imperious beauty bows to sordid gold,
 Her smiles,
 whence heaven flows emanent,
 are sold; And affectation swells th' entrancing tones,
 Which nature subjugates,
 and truth disowns.
 I love th' ingenuous maiden,
 practised not To pierce the heart with ambush'd glances,
 shot From eyelashes,
 whose shadowy length she knows To a hair's point,
 their high arch when to close Half o'er the
swimming orb,
 and when to raise,
 Disclosing all the artificial blaze Of unfelt passion,
 which alone can move Him whom the genuine eloquence
of love Affected never,
 won with wanton wiles,
 With soulless sighs,
 and meretricious smiles; By nature unimpress'd,
 uncharm'd by thee,
 Sweet goddess of my heart,
 Simplicity!


The longer I live and the more I see Of
the struggle of souls towards the heights above,
 The stronger this truth comes home to me--- That
the Universe rests on the shoulders of love,
 A love so limitless,
 deep,
 and broad,
 That men have re-named it,
 and called it God.
 And nothing that was ever born or evolved,
 Nothing created by light or force But deep in
its system there lies dissolved A shining drop from the
great Love source; A shining drop that shall live for
aye; Though kingdoms may perish and stars decay.


I stare at The night sky Wondering,
 what if? Then I realize god Is the answer.
 I see love real concern a feeling That wells
up inside.
 My love for Christ is Overwhelming.
 And at times I see Him clearly and think.
 He’s right here,
 and yet He is everywhere.
 A gift that keeps giving.
 A love that is uncontrollable.
 If I’m alone all I truly want is The
love of my life,
 Christ.
 With Christ I am filled,
 And no longer wonder The earth in search of
that Missing love.
 It’s simple if your Looking.
 Look towards A book that has his story And
our journey written In it.
 Look up,
 lift up your heads.
 For your redemption draws Near.
 -Briana


A pure  and kind love,
 That's as gentle as a dove.
 That sweet and tender love,
 That is only given from above.
 The kind of love people search for everyday,
 The kind that never goes away.
 God has provided love for us,
 That kind of love you can always trust.
 God's love is one of a kind,
 That kind of love is so hard to find.


Love Love.
 I need you now.
 Reign down on me melodies from heaven.
 Fix me now that I am broken.
 Heal my mind so that I may recall love.
 I wait at the door.
 Searching for you to save my life from the
dark,
 I hope as a needle in a haystack you'll
find me lying for you.
 Love,
 why are you gone so far away? I mean
no harm to you,
 I just want to lye in your cloud of
enthusiasm.
 Whenever your dreams come true,
 and you conquer the best of both worlds.
 Family and work,
 I want to be there under your umbrella for
the rain.
 Love.
 I need you now.
 Give into me.
 Don't forget about the time you first held me
up in your arms.
 Your third love affair,
 account payable to me.
 I don't think I want to be free.
 I practiced the lines a thousand times,
 until I had them memorized.
 The issue of love.
 I need to know your love.
 Don't scream anymore.
 I think of you alongside the lifeless water.
 In sunburn,
I am roasting in the summer microwave,
 as I'm roasting in your memories of your love.
 I want you.
 I was just making up for love.
 I don't know much more about such a prosperous
place.
 Behind the veil,
 a little bird I rely on to take care
of me and wage of you.
 I think I can be influential for you to
know that it's a sign of high hopes and dreams
to fulfill your love.
 I want to know what love is.
 Show me.
 I was just thinking of you.
 I want to be everywhere you are; your number
one topic in your essay.
 Can I be with you and overstay until I
become satisfied with your love? I want to watch you,
 like you're only mine.
 An imagination that won't suppress under holy thoughts.
 There's something else in my heart I need to
say.
 I think that I should start by saying I
really want to see you,
 and you are so beautiful,
 now that you have gotten my attention.
 I really think that I am in love with
you.
 Love,
 I'm interested in you,
 because there's just some queerieness in your hands.
 Oh,
 yeah!
 I don't know if you can witness me reaching
out for your love.
 How I can fathom the fandom of your worshippers
all day,
 my fingers tied,
 I don't mind being your dessert.
 Save a little room for more of me later,
 but I really want to make your best love.
 Because being in this corrupt madness of the single
life,
 can grow old enough to make living regretful,
 using broken parts and pieces as the blunt murder
instrument of a murder trial,
 so love.
 How are you doing? Tell me what is it
that you have in mind? I'm not going anywhere without
your ingenious.
 See I've been around you for way too long.
 Nothing feels right when you're not around.
 Oh,
 love.
 Love me now.
 I'm going to love you now.
 Don't wait for tomorrow to give me my flowers.
 I'm going to love you now.

It sure is like a chameleon;Looks alike a million Sounds
like a zillion;It sure is a chameleon Staring into space
Wondering if you'll ever find it And then you find
it You see it;You live it You have it;You feel
it You can almost touch it It sure is chameleon;Looks
alike a million Sounds like a zillion;It sure is a
chameleon Then,
 poof!
 Its gone Woof!
 Like a little puppy in pain I'm little bumpy
you say Is it gone Or has it just changed
color? It sure is a chameleon;Looks alike a million Sounds
like a zillion;It is a chameleon


What is your purpose? How do I be happy without
you? How do I get over you? Love Why do
you make me think? Do things for people Why are
you so blind? So painful So memorable Why do you
hurt Why does it hurt to love Why can’t I
understand you Love You can stay with us In our
hearts In our heads In our soul Love Why can’t
you talk Why is the drug I need you Why
can’t you be easy to understand Easy to find Love
Why do your hurt to feel Why are you the
reason humans cheat Why does it hurt Love Why can’t
you be easy as a mother’s love? Easy as a
little kid's love for toys Why do you have to
be so hard on our hearts? Love Why do you
bring us pain that we will remember Who are you
love What is love The reason so many cry at
night Love Just have mercy for me one more time
Show me who you really are Show me what the
word “love” means Love Show me why Love Why do
you leave me with questions? With so many whys With
pain With feeling lifeless Love You leave me left with
no heart to give to the next How is the
pain you give me suppose to make me stronger With
no hope left Love Why are you so indecisive? Why
do you leave me feeling heartless? I only think about
at night Why only at night Love You are just
a drug I wasn’t warned about Why do I need
you Why do make families fall apart? Love Why do
make me want to text her Why do you make
certain songs make me cry? Who are you? Love You
showed me how to forget How to still care for
someone who doesn’t care How can you make a family
become a family? Why do you make it hurt to
remember? Love….
 Just why love?


Joy is singing a song joy is singing along joy

free within you soul free to be what you want
free to achieve every goal but love is what you
make it so if you need love be free cause
all your love and giving is deep within thee Jodi

Seeing past the point beyond,
 what lies in the far unknown.
 Looking Over Visions Edge,
 where no one goes alone!


In the vast expanse of this universe wide,
 A love story unfolds,
 like a gentle tide.
 With words as my brush,
 I paint a portrait true,
 A love poem dedicated solely to you.
 In your eyes,
 I see galaxies collide,
 Sparkling with passion,
 impossible to hide.
 With every glance,
 my heart skips a beat,
 Lost in the depths of a love so sweet.
 Your smile,
 a radiant sunlit glow,
 Illuminates my world,
 as rivers of love flow.
 With each curve of your lips,
 my worries fade,
 In your embrace,
 all my fears are swayed.
 Your touch,
 a tender caress so divine,
 Ignites a fire within,
 a love so fine.
 It lingers on my skin,
 like a whispered breeze,
 Filling every inch of me with tender ease.
 In the rhythm of your heartbeat,
 I find my song,
 A melody that carries us both along.
 Together,
 we dance through life's grand ballet,
 In perfect harmony,
 come what may.
 Your laughter,
 a symphony of joy and delight,
 Fills my days and turns darkness to light.
 In your presence,
 happiness takes its form,
 A love that weathers any storm.
 So here's to us,
 in this moment we share,
 A love story written in the stars,
 beyond compare.
 In this poem,
 I pour my heart's refrain,
 Forever and always,
 my love for you will remain.


I find it endearing how the wind blows your name
like that.
 Like the ghost of a kiss,
 the caress of fingertips agaisn't your cheek,
 so soft and tender - A love's song.
 It's amusing,
 the way the breeze blows my love out on
your face,
 peppering it with kisses.


The greatest gift in the world is live.
 Love is tender,
 love is kind.
 Love is heavenly,
 it's so divine.
 John 3:
16,
 states " For God so love the world he
gave us only son.
" With true love,
 we would be our brothers keeper.
 The world needs love and kindness.
 If we would love our brothers and sisters.
 There would be no wars,
 no crime,
.
and no hate.
 The nature of man needs to change.
 But sin is the Cross that we bare.
 Let love reign in our life.
 Be kind to those in need.
 Also,
 show love to animals and all creatures for God
is the creator of everything and God is live.
 Always remember that true love,
 we can live in a world of peace and
harmony.


It be a tiny spark Or a widespread wildfire.
 It be an itch of  heart Or a plunge
of desire.
 It be a war of emotions Or a truce
of hearts.
 It be living with memories Even when the way
parts.
 It be a tree in the desert With not
much to spare.
 It be rain-bearing clouds Rarely being fair.
 It be a never-healing wound Even after you mature.
 It be a virus that corrupts Even the souls
very pure.
 It be the greatest of mysteries To you and
to me.
 Love,
 my friend is something I didn't expect it'd be.


The love is yet sinking and my eyes are Yet
searching for the ray of light which awakens my soul
once again trying to find Shelter in the coast of
river bank.
 Where I can go lost for days and nights.
 And yet look vulnerable,
 and stare the stars in the moon lit night
and yet learning to face my fret; Yet my feet
touches the sand and I still can't get enough as
I try to stare.
 And embrace the stars and yet waiting for a
magic to happen though some waves,
 yet disturb the beauty of my mind.


I didn't expect to love you as much as I
thought I would I hide it for years without even
realizing that I loved you until about four years later.
 You are okay if people.
 You saw me when I didn't even know myself,
 saw the wall melting right off of me just
like the Shinedown.
 I know I just told you and I know
you're avoiding me like a hawk.
 We've both colored outside of the lines of what
teachers or what other people say.
 I saw when the people bullied you and REALLY
hated it.
 I get it.
 I feel you.


कुछ खास सा रिश्ता हैं हमारा तुम्हारा,
 कुछ खास सा रिश्ता हैं हमारा तुम्हारा तुम  कहते
तो हो की दूर चली जाओ,
 मुझ से और दुसरे ही पल ढूंढनते हो मुझे,
 क्या ये वही है राहत जो समझ रही हूं,
 या कुछ या समाझाना चाहते हो मुझे ,
रिश्ते की उलझन तो समझ आती नहीं मुझे ,
क्या तुम कह नहीं सकते,
 कुछ खास सा रिश्ता है हमारा तुम्हारा इतना कहना
कफी होगा,
 अगर तुम कहोगे तो समझ जाऊंगी कुछ खास सा
रिश्ता सा हमारा तुम्हारा ये वही राहत हैं जो समझ
रही हूं मैं


ਆਪਣੇ ਸੁਪਨੇ ਦੀ ਕੀ ਸਿਫ਼ਤ ਕਰਾ ਕੋਈ ਅੱਖਰ ਦਾ ਕੋਈ
ਸਾਰ ਨਹੀਂ। ਰਾਤ ਦਾ ਚਾਨਣ  ਵੀ ਓਹਦੇ ਅੱਗੇ ਫਿਖਾ ਜਾਪੇ
ਓਹਦੀਆਂ ਅੱਖਾ ਦਾ ਨੂਰ ਸੁਪਨਾ ਬਣਕੇ ਚਮਕਦੀਆ ਨੇ ਕੀ ਕਰਾਂ
ਸਿਫ਼ਤ ਨੂਰ ਅਪਣੇ ਦੀ ,
 ਅੱਖਰ ਸਮਝ ਨਾ ਓਹਦਾ ਏ। ਓਹਦੀਆਂ ਨਜ਼ਰਾ ਵਿੱਚ ਮੇਰਾ
ਚਿਹਰਾ ਦਿਖਦਾ ਏ ਇਹ ਦੇਖ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਪਾਣੀ ਡਿੱਗਦਾ ਏ
ਕੋਈ ਕਿਦਾ ਕਰ ਸਕਦਾ ਏ,
 ਏਨਾ ਜਾਦਾ ਪਿਆਰ। ਮੇਰੀਆਂ ਅੱਖਾਂ ਵਿੱਚ ਨਾ ਜਰਦਾ ਹੰਝੂ
ਏ,
 ਇਹੀ ਰੱਬ ਦਾ ਕੋਈ  ਦੀਦਾਰ ਏ। ਇਹ ਸਮਝ  ਆਇਆ
 ਰੱਬਾ ,
 ਰੱਬ ਦਾ ਦੂਜਾ ਨਾਂ ਹੀ  ਪਿਆਰ ਸੱਜਣਾ । ।।


These are your own words your way of noticing and
saying plainly of not turning away from hurt you have
offered them to me    I am only giving them back
if only I could show you how very useless they
are not


I was at my desk when in he came.
 His hair was dark,
 his eyes the same.
 Excited,
 I blurted,
 almost a shout.
 "Hey you,
 would you like to go out?" His smile told
me all I needed to know.
 And that was over thirty years ago!
 We're married now,
 for twenty years.
 Most of that was filled with tears.
 He drank,
 he lied,
 he ran away.
 But I still loved him to this day.
 Ten years ago,
 consumed with strife.
 He put down the bottle and  took back his
life.
 His eyes are still dark,
 his hair not so much.
 His smile is for me and so is his
touch.
 I weathered the bad times and cherished the good.
 The first time I saw him,
 I knew that I would.
 Still my love!


Love


You come to me in the quiet moments You fill
my heart with joy.
 You speak so softly to me You set my
spirit free.
 You guide me in good times and in bad
And sometimes you even make me feel sad.
 You are my thoughts,
 my whispering heart I know now we shall never
part.
 Some people call you poetry,
  I call you love I feel you in my
heart,
 you come from God above.
 I treasure my moments with you A gift from
God,
  I know it's true.
 If I would ever lose you I know I
would be blue.
 So I'll keep my pen in my hand And
you in my heart right to the end.


Love Love,
 my soulful love,
 Flew away with the flow.
 The flow that everyone followed.
 The flow that came from a gentle blow.
 I know,
 teasing is to be endured,
 still it came unbearable.
 Love,
 my only love.
 It is not a movie,
 But gone with the wind is a flow.
 It’s a flow.
 Love,
 my mere love.
 It suffered with love.
 I know,
 How foolish of a word love,
 Tobe deprived at the age of six.
 Love,
 what a chore.
 To be pushed and sworn,
 Love,
 a mere joke,
 Love,
 do you believe in love? Sarcasm replenished its own
intricacy with the utter.
 I don’t hate you,
 I hate love.
 No love,
 because of love I know the flow,
 To bring you in love.
 Rock bottom I am,
 Love to nothingness,
 love to emptiness.
 Easy but love,
 love is easy,
 How trickery.
 How much inconsistency.
 My love is gone,
 not with the wind,
 My love is forever gone.
 My love,
 my love,
 No meaning greater than hate but love.
 My love has gone with the flow.
 My presence has stopped the boastful,
 If love.
 Love,
 If love,
 I won’t need you.
 And I know of you,
 because of love.
 No!
 I don’t need love.
 I don’t desire love.
 Crumb bread and love.
 I don’t want more love.
 My love has gone with the flow.
 The flow of the eternal.
 I loathe.
 I know.
 Not mere love but love.
 My own soul.
 Take me to the deep inception,
 of no pure love but love.
 I won’t have it.
 I know.
 Anguish has been gone with the flow.
 No love like a cold sore,
 everyone shuns.
 No love like a genital,
 no one shows.
 Love,
 is forever gone with the flow.
 My pain is irreverent but mere flow.
 My love has gone with the flow.
 My soul has been gone a long time ago.


I spent half of my life in shadows.
 No one ever had belief in me.
 I always stood in the shadow.
 Until one day when my life was almost over.
 A gentle hand picked me up and said "
you are worth saving"   it wasn't a easy trip,
 he traveled with her story.
   This man stayed with her and picked her up.
  He told her I believe in your dreams,
 and I'll be there to pick you up.
  This girl decided to believe in herself,
 because no one else wouldn't.
 This girl now believes in herself.


What is love you might ask It's the feeling of
your breath Upon my neck across my back Every carress
feels just like that The smile you give as each
of you pass Pass through the halls Passing across the
street The smile you give when you first meet The
ever blossoming trust that comes Trust that is unbroken,
 never gone astray Trust that is with you every
day Being with the one who brings out the best
The best in everything to make you a success What
is love you might ask It's all the above Sweet
breaths and smiles Sugar coating for miles Success of the
storms you have weathered through Beginning each blessed day anew
Touching your souls with each act you do Acts of
love that come from both of you.

Love is a beautiful bridge,
 that blooms between life and grief,
 It flows gently from within and that has always
been.
 Love let’s flowers bloom,
 even where there is always fume.
 Love is patient,
 Love is kind,
 It doesn’t envy neither does it mind.
 Love is bigger than four letters,
 Far more beautiful than it appears.
 Love bonds a family,
 It connects us all,
 There’s nothing more than love,
 It makes you fit in like a glove


Love is the soothing voice of gods To which men
ever list.
 Love is the ease of soul's travail And sorrow's
alchemist.


is duniya mai akela tha par vo pata nhi kaha
sa meri zindagi mai aa gayi Pata nhi chala ki
kab vo mere dil mai sama gayi Tab sa deere-deere
hamari mulakaat hone lagi Thodi-thodi par dil ko sukoon dene
wali baat hone lagi Tab kuch mahine baad pata nhi
usse kya hua usne mujhe mana kar diya Chup ka
dekha to usse to pata chala usne kisi aur ko
hi apna kar diya Lagta hai mera bhagwan mujhse rutha
padha hai Usse lagta hai usne tod diya mera dil
par usse kya pata is ladke ka dil to phale
sa hi tutaa pada hai


love is formal and pure,
 even the word can make you explore a mile
of expression that says it all.
 world of wonders begins with someone's feelings.
 someones heart is much value than gold and silver
it means the whole universe to them.
 butterflies flew among us,
 inside and out they roam about.
 heart beats into a song of sweet melody tune
while the angels guide us together.
 never look for love because love always finds a
way of finding you


It's crazy how it happened I figured it was meant
to be I swear I must be dreaming There's no
way this can be I tried to tell my friends
They too look in disbelief I swear I must be
dreaming Quick someone come pinch me I try to utter
sound But nothing escapes me I swear I must be
dreaming That's the only place it takes me I write
it and write it Over and over and over again
I swear I must be dreaming It somehow controls my
pen I shiver with excitement Whenever you're around This feeling
is so different I know it's so profound I just
can't explain it I know cause I've tried Whatever it
is I'm feeling I feel it deep inside What can
be so elusive So hard to grasp But yet it
sits there Do I really have to ask.

Love is it really black and white if love comes
from the light How do I embrace new beginnings How
do I accept the winnings Love and Pain is it
supposed to create chains Love is about setting you free
Dropping to my Knees Love leaving me empty and hopeless
Love brought me to Homeless


Love Love,
 sweet love,
 the source of joy and pain,
 A force that moves the heart and bends the
brain.
 It can lift us up to soaring heights,
 Or bring us low with cruel delights.
 In love we find a sense of purpose true,
 A bond that binds our hearts and souls anew.
 But love,
 like all things,
 can fade and die,
 Leaving naught but ashes,
 tears,
 and sighs.
 So let us cherish love while it is here,
 Embrace it with our hearts,
 our minds,
 our tear.
 For love,
 though fleeting,
 is a precious thing,
 A fleeting fire that warms the heart and soul,
 And gives our lives a sense of worth and
whole.


Didn't have to go to the street of love ,
 don't know how to reach there ,
 now have to get out of this street,
 but now forgot the way to come home.


Love is like a company Without defined hierarchy No one
is a boss Not even a servant Neither a security
guard Nor a cook Love involve two partners Love is
not a school To be run by a board Neither
it is a church Attended by every member Nor a
business Organized by shareholders Love involve two partners Love is
like a pin Drawn towards a magnet Partners held Closed
like shutters Sticky and aqueous Just like a glue Love
binds two people Love is like a clock Moving very
slow Tomorrow sounds a thousand years Thousands miles away Years
of laughter True love never fade Love require knowledge Knowing
something about everything Jack of all traders And a master
of none Love,
 field of specialization Love involve only two patners Love
is like a poem Composed by two poets Love repeatedly
Accompanied by rhyming words Assonance and alliteration Love is poetic
in nature Love is like a pine trees Roots rooted
to the ground Beyond the world of reasoning Firm and
stable But take long to mature Just like a Rome
Not build in a single day Love and laugh long
Never compare love with wealth Love is happiness Peace,
 quiet and contentment But not heartless Double-crossing cheat!
 Love has boundaries I can't imagine love What is
it on earth? Center of joy? Love,
 laugh and live long


I love you You love me We love each other
so dearestly I love you so much I'm getting on
one knee Baby girl will you marry me Please say

love won't carry on less


I like you and that makes 2 I want to
care and I want to bare I'm locked behind your
bars and your as beautiful as the stars I'm in
love and it is strong


Love is funny charming as a bunny it makes some
feel lonely yet it's sweet as honey life is a
mystery is based on history and may sometimes leads to
miserly and hate this is your fate


Roses are red,
  violets are blue,
   I love you always.
 just as you have loved too.


I woke up this morning dropped by the dew a
letter from someone golden an angel like you I met
when I got older the sign of the feast does
it widen with the river or size right back creating
alchemy a heart attach it could be a dozen split
sunder how the rhymes roll in thunder or turn the
Paige quiet while we light sage


i visit my 92 year old Aunt Evie we sit
together l i s t e n i n g

about was infact the very first reason that made you
read all the lines in harmony till this line; O!
 yes what I am about to convey; is already
at the top of your minds; for it is none
other than love
